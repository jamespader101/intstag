number four and I love this one is that you're wasting time and what is going on YouTube if you don't know who I am which is probably till my name is Brandon Dion and thank you for stopping by my chin in this video I want to talk to you guys about what you're doing wrong on Instagram and how to actually get your first 1,000 followers there's already so many videos on YouTube of how to grow how it like including on my channel you like you'll see them everywhere there's not a lot of videos that talk about what you're actually doing wrong and was actually hurting your account so instead of telling you what to do cuz I've already made a bunch of videos that explain that I'm gonna tell you when you're doing wrong turn your account and was just not gonna help you in the long run so if you follow my instruction you can actually grow your following to a thousand people in 48 hours and when I say 48 hours I mean like you know four hours a day three hours a day but I don't really like to use.



How to Get Your First 1000 Followers on Instagram - Medium :

 the click baby titles but you wanna clicked on this damn video if I didn't make a click baby title so I mean 48 hours spread and most spread throughout like two weeks is kind of more what I was like aiming at anyway guys here are the five things that you need to listen to right now if you want a thousand followers on Instagram alright guys so you want to get 1000 followers on Instagram well you and everybody else I'm gonna tell you what's most likely holding you back from actually getting that first 1000 in the first place I'm gonna break it down into five different things okay yeah there's a lot of different things but I mean five main things that like we can break them down into those categories and you need to stop doing these things right now because they're only hurting your account yeah just pay attention all right the first thing that I made on this little note that I wrote out earlier is that you are making it about you so what do I mean by that you're posting which is great but you're making it about yourself like nobody cares like I got a newsflash for you and it might sound mean but nobody gives a nobody cares about you it's really not mean.



How to gain 1000 active followers on instagram in 1 week: 

 because it's just the reality think about it if there's somebody vlogging in Europe somewhere they're in France if you're from France I'm sorry they're vlogging and they're telling you what they breakfast they don't have any followers like they're not popular at all nobody knows who they are and they're trying to tell you what they're eating and like you don't care that they had cereal for breakfast like why are you going to you're not gonna watch that right so if they were making it a boat not themself that's kind of a good way to say it and they were making it about the viewer as opposed to themselves then you'd pay more attention okay Brandon so how do they make it about the viewer how do they make it not about themselves glad you asked in order to make it about the viewer you need to give them value in some way for example I make a lot of videos that you see on my profile like how to do this on guitar I had to play five beautiful chords that video come here over 200,000 views and it wasn't about me it was about the viewer because a lot of my viewers are guitar players and they want to learn how to play guitar I have a jazz degree right there that qualifies me makes me an expert at this thing right here that feels really weird to say because I mean I don't really think of myself as an expert but I have paper to prove it anyway so yeah I make lesson videos and people actually care and that's why it did so well that video blew up on my profile like over 200,000 views and I got a lot of followers from that one video two days ago.



1000 followers on Instagram - High Contrast - Facebook: 

I had 27,000 now I have 28,000 because people like they save it they save those posts because they can learn from it so if you have any sort of expertise in any area some are more exciting to watch than others some you know some are more relevant but if you have something that you could share you know share it with your audience provide them value because they don't care about you but they might care about what you have to say if it's gonna affect them positively with that being said well I know what that is and start giving give to them and they will follow you and eventually you can just make it more about you when you have the leverage but when you're just starting out you don't have any leverage the second thing that I wrote on this list that I created for this video is that you aren't posting consistently kind of like me on YouTube I don't post very consistently I don't need to tell you guys post consistently have you attend posts you're not going to grow simple as that post consistently find out what works make mistakes don't worry about being judged by making bad posts learn from the bad posts and then learn from the good posts because of your posting consistently you're gonna be able to pretty soon differentiate between the two and start post consistently number three on my list right here is that you aren't unique you're not unique like I'll use guitar repost pages as an example for this there are so many pages that are like out there that repost music content but they're just sharing the same videos.



HOW TO GAIN 1,000 ACTIVE INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS: 

as the big pages so why are you gonna follow a small page when you can just follow a big page and they're posted in the same videos you're not gonna follow the small page you're gonna stay following the big page because it's more popular and for some reason people like things that are popular who would have thought the solution to making yourself unique is that you've got to separate yourself the way you do this is by looking at the competition analyzing the competition and finding a way to remix what they're doing into your own video your own type of content so learn from the best then remix it into something and until you make it your own and then that will separate yourself and if you don't do that then you're not going to separate yourself and nobody's going to follow you because you're the same as bigger pages that they already follow number four and I love this one is that you're wasting time in DM and engagement groups guys I hate these groups I hate when people message me and say have you all joined the young group it's so annoying you guys like they don't work they just don't work if your post needs to be engaged with and like it needs people commenting on it to boost it to put it on to explore it's not gonna win like it you lost like it's not gonna work you guys I don't use the M groups I've been a member of a few DM groups in my life and I found.

 it never made a difference because my videos were always going on to explore anyway as long as you follow the Instagram algorithm you post consistently you post stories that you use 5 hashtags instead of a thousand you're gonna go on to explore if your content is good enough if your content isn't good and you're having people engage with it because you're in a DM group well Instagram is just gonna punish your account because that's what they do now that it's 2018 and they've sniffed out all those DM groups and they punish your account in like yeah they just it's waste of time guys don't do it you're gonna get shadow man like it's it's stupid so just make good content by being consistent and like these things are all related to each other you just post a lot you post a lot of content and you find out what works you find out what doesn't work and then you that's how you do it that's how you find out what works and then you post it and you don't need the DM group to engage with it because it's gonna be engaged with naturally then it's gonna go get shot to explore and a DM group would just be a waste of your time anyway because then you have to comment on all these people's stuff and it's like man like I don't want to do that I like who wants to do that number 5 is that you are spamming hashtags like I just said this I guess but yeah don't use a thousand hashtags I mean technically you can only use like 30 I think it is but I only use 5 because when Instagram changed in 2018 when the algorithm was adjusted it really was against using a lot of hashtags so don't use that don't use a shitload of hashtags used 5 I use 5 on every single one of my posts and I have posts with over 300,000 views with 5 hush tags .

the hashtags aren't making me as much of a difference as you guys think they really aren't so don't stress over them and just use 5 keep it within your niche whatever your niche is mine's guitar so I use guitar related hashtags every time you want to keep changing them you don't want to always use the same ones because if you just copy and paste like what a lot of people do then Instagram is gonna see that you're just doing that it's gonna treat it as spam it's gonna hurt your account in the long run don't do it this is coming from a guy who spends way too much time on Instagram so if you cut out all these garbage techniques that don't even work that is so important that's gonna help you get to that 1,000 followers in the first place when I say you're gonna get a thousand followers in two days I literally mean two days like I mean 48 hours worth of effort so if you don't sleep you could get it all done within that two day period but assuming that you want to sleep you know you're spaced out that 48 hours throughout two weeks and you know 3-4 hours a day of hustle on Instagram and posting and all that stuff and that's how you're gonna do it I don't like to use click baby titles but you guys want to click on my damn video if I didn't make a clickbait title in the first place and Plus this isn't really clickbait because it's it's true I mean with 48 hours of effort.



 you can definitely make it to a thousand followers so scrap those techniques guys that don't work and I know what you might be thinking you might be thinking well I mean these techniques they seem like really good to me and they I think that they work and I don't want to stop using them but guys you need to listen to me I have 28,000 followers and I don't want to say that to brag but I do want to say it to get myself their credentials I have done the work I've spent a lot of time on Instagram like I said an embarrassing amount of time and if you don't have a thousand followers you need to listen to somebody who's done it you need to listen somebody who has already proven themselves I have already proven myself so don't listen to somebody who has 2,000 followers and they're following 4,000.

 people because they spam follow don't listen to somebody like that listen to somebody who has already done it and already proven themselves listen to me that sounds so braggy but I mean it's true guys like listen to me don't listen to like people that don't know what they're talking about if you want more tips on Instagram and how to grow to your first 1000 followers just look at my channel like I've already made a lot of videos and if you watch all those videos then there's no question in my mind that you will reach that first thousand followers within two days 48 hours of effort which I mean realistically isn't more like four hours a day three hours a day of effort because I mean you you need to sleep and you need to eat I mean you need that time but again I don't like to click bait stuff but it works so I mean can you blame me so that being said if you guys enjoyed this video you found it useful make sure you subscribe to me here on you and follow me on instagram and i will see you guys [Music]
